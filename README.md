# web-galleries

A collection of web galleries running html, js and css. SimpleLightbox implementation and some other utilities.
The objective is to give a simple way to implement a portfolio through Github>Cloudflare.
I believe that trusting your stuff to a "big" site comes with ugly risks--just read their TOS).

## Manga Reader
A simple, yet effective manga reader.
Nothing fancy. No external dependencies or DBs.
Very easy to use.

## Image Gallery
A template to make your online portfolio.
Simple to implement and client-friendly (the most important thing).
Basic implementation of SimpleLightBox (as an external dependency, though. You can make it local if you care).
